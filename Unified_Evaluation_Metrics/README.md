# Unified Evaluation Metrics

This folder provides the implementation of **unified evaluation metrics** for comparing spectral estimators,  
including both the Symmetric Spectral Estimator (SSE) and Asymmetric Spectral Estimator (ASE).

### **Contents**
- **Subspace Alignment Evaluation**  
  Calculates subspace recovery accuracy using Frobenius-based overlap metrics.
- **Spectral Point Classification**  
  Categorizes eigenvalues into red, orange, green, and purple clusters for stability analysis.
- **Combined Metrics Analysis**  
  Provides unified scoring for individual and paired spectral points to evaluate overall estimator performance.

### **Key Features**
- Unified framework applicable to both SSE and ASE.
- Visualization tools for alignment heatmaps and spectral behavior.
- GPU-accelerated evaluation for large-scale experiments.
