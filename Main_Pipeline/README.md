# Main_Pipeline

This folder contains the **final consolidated implementation** of the core experiments,  
demonstrated using the sampling ratio **Î± = 5** as an example.

## Included Files

1. **ASE_Minimal_Demo.ipynb**  
   - Demonstrates the **construction** of the **Asymmetric Spectral Estimator (ASE)**.
   - Includes all **three evaluation systems** and the **corresponding heatmap visualizations**.

2. **SSE_Minimal_Demo.ipynb**  
   - Demonstrates the **construction** of the **Symmetric Spectral Estimator (SSE)**.
   - Includes the **evaluation system** and **heatmap visualizations**.

3. **Stability Evaluation of Green Eigenvalues.ipynb**  
   - Investigates the **stability** of **internal signal eigenvalues (green points)** in ASE.
   - Validates **three hypotheses** on the persistence and stability of these eigenvalues  
     across multiple trials.

> **Note**  
> Other scripts in the repository are exploratory attempts, such as testing different  
> sampling ratios, alternative preprocessing functions, and debugging experiments.
